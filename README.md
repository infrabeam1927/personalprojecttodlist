# personal project to do list
A Python program that implements a basic to-do list, which involves the use of lists and dictionaries:
This program uses a list todo_list to store the tasks, and each task is represented as a dictionary with the keys "task_name", "task_description", and "completed". The main_menu function implements a simple user interface that allows the user to add tasks, view tasks, complete tasks, and quit the program. The program uses the while loop to continuously display the menu until the user chooses to quit.
